### Day 0: August 1, 2022 (Mon)

#### Day 0: Learning

- Initializing a reset on my #100DaysOfCode with Python journey
- Many lessons learned and redirects during the initial attempt
- The ultimate goal = proficient Python developer
- The task = balance learning with doing; emphasis on learning by doing
- The challenge = series of coding exercises and projects
- The target = code, code, code ... get better with each week/sprint
- Resources: Python Basics review, Python Projects (core, AWS, Serverless)

#### Day 0: Coding

- Core: continue learning journey of "mastering" the Python language
- AWS: focus skills on automating & developing in the cloud
- Serverless: greatest interest in learning Serverless development

#### Day 0: Thoughts

- Excited about the reboot/reset of my Python learning journey
- I want to balance building a solid foundational skillset with learning AWS and Serverless
- Key = building as many projects in a progressively increasing difficulty
- Ultimate Goal = a Cloud Developer / DevOps role where I can contribute from Ops background and growing Dev proficieny.
- I want to log my journey here for learning, but, I also want to leverage blogging my learnings (#LearnInPublic) between LI/Twitter and Code Character Blog.  TBD on implementing consistently.
